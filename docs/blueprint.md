## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #7289DA (a vibrant blue-purple) to give a modern and trustworthy impression, steering clear of the more typical and expected blue used in existing social media platforms. It gives a contemporary impression, like Discord, but still alludes to earlier more established brands.
- Background color: #2C2F33 (a dark desaturated purple) to support the modern/tech aesthetic, create excellent contrast, and focus the eye on content.
- Accent color: #99AAB5 (a light desaturated blue) for subtle highlighting and interactive elements.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and readable experience.
- Simple, outline-style icons for navigation and actions.
- Clean, card-based layout for posts and user profiles.
- Subtle animations for interactions, such as likes and new post notifications.
